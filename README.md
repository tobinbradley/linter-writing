# linter-writing

A package for [Atom](http://atom.io) Linter for subjective linting of Markdown documents. This is set up exactly how I like it, but my inner linter/masochist probably isn't tuned the same as yours; use it as a starting point rather than a final solution.

The package uses:  

*   [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark)
*   [retext](https://github.com/wooorm/retext)
*   [remark-lint](https://github.com/wooorm/remark-lint) for markdown linting
*   [retext-english](https://github.com/wooorm/retext-english)
*   [retext-equality](https://github.com/wooorm/retext-equality)
*   [retext-profanities](https://github.com/wooorm/retext-profanities)
*   [retext-readability](https://github.com/wooorm/retext-readability)
*   [retext-simplify](https://github.com/wooorm/retext-simplify)

Hat tip to [linter-markdown](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-markdown) and [retext-mapbox-standard](https://github.com/mapbox/retext-mapbox-standard) for code and inspiration.

Hat tip to me and you for code and inspiration.

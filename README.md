# linter-writing

A package for [Atom](http://atom.io) Linter that performs subjective linting on Markdown documents. This is set up exactly how I like it, but my inner linter/masochist probably isn't tuned the same as yours; use it as a starting point rather than a final solution.

The plugin uses [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark) and [retext](https://github.com/wooorm/retext), along with [remark-lint](https://github.com/wooorm/remark-lint) (markdown linting), [retext-english](https://github.com/wooorm/retext-english), [retext-equality](https://github.com/wooorm/retext-equality), [retext-profanities](https://github.com/wooorm/retext-profanities), [retext-readability](https://github.com/wooorm/retext-readability), and [retext-simplify](https://github.com/wooorm/retext-simplify), along with some custom filtering for particular words and acronyms.

Credit goes to [linter-markdown](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-markdown) for code ideas and [retext-mapbox-standard](https://github.com/mapbox/retext-mapbox-standard) for the inspiration and some industry acronyms.
